# ExamPro Online Exam Management System â€” Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Bootstrapping
- Use `scripts/scaffold_laravel.sh` to generate the Laravel application skeleton.
- Configure environment variables (`.env`) for MySQL, mail, cache, and broadcasting.
- Install Laravel Breeze with TailwindCSS for authentication scaffolding.
- Configure Vite and Tailwind (CDN fallback) to support responsive, mobile-first UI.

## 2. Core Domain Modeling
| Area | Models | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity & Access | User, Role, Permission, SessionLock | Use policies/gates for RBAC and prevent multiple sessions. |
| Exams & Content | Exam, ExamType, Category, Question, QuestionMedium, AnswerOption, Resource, Lesson, Schedule | Support all question types and adaptive learning resources. |
| Transactions | PricingPlan, Subscription, Payment, RewardLedger, Transaction | Integrate Paystack and manual transfers. |
| Analytics | Score, Attempt, QuestionStat, ActivityLog | Provide dashboards and progress tracking. |
| Settings | Setting, FeatureToggle, LandingPageSection | Allow admin control over landing content and system behavior. |

## 3. Database & Seeders
- Create migrations for each model with attention to soft deletes, indexing, and foreign key constraints.
- Implement factories and seeders for dummy data: admins, categories, question banks, and pricing plans.
- Use seeders to configure default landing page sections and reward settings.

   - Admin guard via Laravel Breeze.
   - Middleware to enforce verified email and active subscription checks.
2. **Dashboard**

## 8. DevOps & Tooling
